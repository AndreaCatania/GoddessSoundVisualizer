Blueprint example project: [Here](https://github.com/AndreaCatania/GoddessSoundVisualizer/blob/master/GoddessSoundVis.rar?raw=true)

Allow you to create a visualizer of sound with blueprint. While other visualizer are not working out of editor this plugin works well.

This plugin uses low resources, because all data needed are precalculated during the importing of the wav file.

Controll your sound overtime using Play, Stop, Pause, Resume functions directly on Blueprint. Visualize the sound by catch **OnUpdateFrequency** event and then create the effect you want.
